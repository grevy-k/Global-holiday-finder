Global Public Holiday FinderüìÖ
Overview
Web App: https://www.grevy.tech/
The Global Public Holiday Finder is a web application designed to help users easily discover public holidays across multiple countries. The application is hosted on two servers for redundancy and is fronted by a load balancer to ensure high availability.

Features
Holiday Search: Users can search for public holidays by country and year.

API Integration: The web app integrates with a third-party API to fetch holiday data for countries.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Interactive Interface: Simple and clean user interface to provide an easy experience for finding public holidays.

How the Load Balancer Works
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic between two servers, ensuring high availability and reliability for the web application. It helps to handle larger traffic loads by redirecting requests in a balanced manner, making sure that users do not experience downtime.

Both servers are set up with identical copies of the web application!

The load balancer ensures that if one server is down, traffic is redirected to the other, maintaining continuous service.

SSL certificates are configured on the load balancer to ensure secure HTTPS connections.

API Integration üåê

Integration Process:

Use JavaScript to fetch data from these APIs.

The web app integrates with a third-party public holiday API to fetch the most up-to-date and accurate holiday data. The API provides holiday information for countries around the world, making it easy for users to discover holiday dates.

API Endpoint: The app sends requests to the API, specifying the country and year, and retrieves holiday data.

Error Handling: In case of a failed request (like a wrong country or year), the app will show a user-friendly error message.

When users select a country and year, the front-end sends a request to the API.

The API responds with the holiday data, and the web app processes and displays it in a clean and readable format.
