Global Public Holiday Finder📅
Overview
Web App: https://www.grevy.tech/
The Global Public Holiday Finder is a web application designed to help users easily discover public holidays across multiple countries. The application is hosted on two servers for redundancy and is fronted by a load balancer to ensure high availability.

Features
Holiday Search: Users can search for public holidays by country and year.

API Integration: The web app integrates with a third-party API to fetch holiday data for countries.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

Interactive Interface: Simple and clean user interface to provide an easy experience for finding public holidays.

How the Load Balancer Works
The load balancer distributes incoming traffic between two servers, ensuring high availability and reliability for the web application. It helps to handle larger traffic loads by redirecting requests in a balanced manner, making sure that users do not experience downtime.

Both servers are set up with identical copies of the web application!

The load balancer ensures that if one server is down, traffic is redirected to the other, maintaining continuous service.

SSL certificates are configured on the load balancer to ensure secure HTTPS connections.
